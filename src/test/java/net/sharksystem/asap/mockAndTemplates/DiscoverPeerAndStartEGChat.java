/**
 * That's an example. It illustrates how an application can detect a new peer in its surrounding by using
 * the ASAPEnvironmentChangesListener. It send a message to the newly detected peers. There are two test variants:
 * One with the mock, the other with the real asap protocol stack.
 *
 * Some considerations
 * An ASAPEnvironmentChangesListener is called whenever an ASAP peer detects changes in its connections.
 * New connection(s) could have been established or connection(s)) are dropped.
 *
 * For what could such an information be good for?
 * We could initiate a game, a chat, ask to come in a get a special discount for our brand new coffee brand
 * (location based / point of sales advertisement) etc. pp.
 *
 * Interesting question: Should we send a message only to this peer with ASAP?
 *
 * Depends on your apps' security needs. I suggest for most cases:
 * Send an asap message to anybody. Use your application data to describe recipient of this message.
 *
 * Might sound weired at the first glance but consider this: ASAP provides routing in ad-hoc and even scatter nets.
 * It only works if any peer is a potential message recipient and for that reason a router, though.
 * ASAP peer would route messages from known applications (!) if you set a flag.
 *
 * Restrictions on ASAP message recipients are restrictions on ASAP routing capabilities. It is if your would
 * require a very dedicated IP router to transmit your IP packages in Internet.
 *
 * Note: Limiting routing peers is a very crucial feature in ASAP. It allows to set up very high secure applications.
 * Such applications can define what devices (we talk about hardware) are trustworthy. Other devices would not even
 * get notified about any communication. Such applications control their network on a hardware level and not only on
 * a logical level. There is hardly a stronger security thinkable. Drawback: such applications must be aware of that
 * fact and must maintain their network.
 *
 * The gossiping nature of ASAP is very welcome in most cases, though. Any peer becomes a potential router.
 * Your peer will only route messages from applications you explicitly created in the first place.
 * A chat application would not route messages from a chess application if you not explicitly tell otherwise. Moreover:
 *
 * There is a complete public key infrastructure (PKI) in the ASAP universe. Use it if you want to:
 * https://github.com/SharedKnowledge/ASAPCertificateExchange/wiki.
 *
 * That's the suggested way for most applications: Create an application specific data unit.
 * They can also contain the recipient of course. Your messages can be encrypted for the recipient and
 * can be signed by sender.
 *
 * Send those messages to any ASAP peer. ASAP will make the routing and deliver your application messages as soon
 * as possible through an ad-hoc (scatter) network.
 *
 * Following code demonstrates such a first contact behaviour.
